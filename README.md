#BasicEnsembleArgumentation

The BasicEnsembleArgumentation library provides methods to generate reliable results. A data set is classified by several models (classifiers). Different models produce different outputs and the produced outputs are combined by an argumentation approach. The argumentation approach produces a final output through a decision making process. The whole process follows an ensemble architecture.
